Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) policy is to give access to as much data as possible, both technicaly and juridicaly.<br>
Data from the waterquantity netwerk (timeseries, physical parameters like waterlevel) and waterquality network (time series and samples, chemical and ecological parameters) network are stored and can be accessed by a GUI [https://waterinfo.rws.nl].

Beside the GUI, measurement data is available at the data distributielaag (wm-ds-dl) and can directly be accessed by programmers.
To get acces to the data RWS provides a variety of Web APIs described in Slate.
Please use the Slate documentation deployed on this 'git' to get any further information to communicate with the Web API.
Beside a OGC compliant webservice, a set of Rest API services can be found to get access to;
- Actual measurements
- Forecast data
- Historical measurements<br>
Please note that all data is originaly collected from and stored in different systems and therefor can have different code based end-points. Especially historical, actual measurements and forecasting data.
<br>
Please be aware of the discaimer (in Dutch) using the data and Web API [https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/footer/index.aspx].
Information with respect to your privacy (in English) can be found on this link [https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/english/disclaimer/privacy-statement/index.aspx].
