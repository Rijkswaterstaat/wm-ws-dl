### Web API waterdata
Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) policy is to give access to as much data as possible, both technically and juridical.<br>
Data from the water quantity netwerk (timeseries, physical parameters like water level) and water quality network (time series and samples, chemical and ecological parameters) are stored and can be accessed by a GUI [https://waterinfo.rws.nl].

Beside the GUI, measurement data is available at the data distributielaag (wm-ds-dl) and can directly be accessed by programmers.
To get access to the data RWS provides a variety of Web APIs described in Slate.
Please use the Slate documentation deployed on this 'git' to get any further information to communicate with the Web API.
Follow this link https://rijkswaterstaat.github.io/wm-ws-dl/#introduction to the documentation.

Beside a OGC compliant webservice, a set of Rest API services can be found to get access to:
- Actual measurements
- Forecast data
- Historical measurements<br>
Please note that data sources of the different networks can have different code based end-points. Especially historical, actual measurements and forecasting data.

Information with respect to your privacy (in English) can be found on this link [https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/english/disclaimer/privacy-statement/index.aspx].
